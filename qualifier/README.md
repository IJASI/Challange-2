# Project Title
The Loan Qualifier  

The loan Qualifier application allows the end-users to analyze a multitude of loans in seconds while taking the stress out of the loan shopping experience. The user-friendliness of the application’s interface keeps the user at ease while entering private financial data. The application is able to quickly cross-examine loan and financial information to best match the user’s current circumstances which otherwise would be a timely endeavor.
